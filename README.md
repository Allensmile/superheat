# superheat: An R package for supervised heatmaps

*superheat* is an R package for generating supervised heatmaps. Supervised heatmaps serve two primary purposes: (1) visualization of complex data and (2) visualization of model fit. See the [vignette](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rlbarter/superheat/master/vignettes/Vignette.html) for usage.

If you find any bugs, have any feature requests or feedback, please submit an issue.

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rlbarter/superheat")
```

Once you've installed the package, you can load the library in the standard way:

``` r

```



Basic usage:

``` r
